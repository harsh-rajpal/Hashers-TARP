<h2>Abstract</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Gesture recognition is one of the most difficult challenges in computer vision. While recognising traffic police hand signals, one must take into account the speed and dependability of the instructing signal. It is significantly easier to extract the three-dimensional coordinates of skeletons when depth information is given with the photos. Here, we present a method for detecting hand signals that does not rely on skeletons. Instead of skeletons, we employ basic object detectors that have been trained to respond to hand signals. 
<li>Autonomous vehicles require traffic police gesture recognition. Current traffic police gesture identification systems frequently extract pixel-level characteristics from RGB photos, which are incoherent owing to the absence of gesture skeleton features and can result in erroneous results. Existing object detection algorithms enable the detection of automobiles, trees, people, bicycles, animals, and so forth (YOLO). 

<li>In this project, we will employ the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) approach (Deep Learning) to recognise traffic police hand signals. As there are no acceptable datasets available, we shall attempt to generate our own. 
Mediapipe will be utilised in its development.

<h2>Introduction</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Artificial intelligence has been implemented in various industries, particularly in computer vision, improving object detection and classification. Traffic signals play a significant role in traffic flow and safety, and AI can be used to enhance their effectiveness.
    <li>Recognizing traffic police gestures is challenging due to the lack of interpretable features from RGB images and interference from complex environments. Gesture skeleton extractor (GSE) can be used to extract interpretable skeleton coordinate information, eliminating background interference. However, existing deep learning methods are not suitable for handling gesture skeleton features, requiring the development of new methods.
    <li>Previous studies faced limitations due to the reliance on handcrafted components or pixel-level information, resulting in poor recognition performance and weak generalization capability. Autonomous vehicles must also recognize hand signals from traffic controllers in real-time, which can be challenging due to the high speed of the vehicles. Many skeleton-based methods require high computational load or expensive devices, making them unsuitable for real-time processing.
    <li>Prior approaches used skeleton-based action recognition to identify hand signals in videos, requiring preprocessing and limiting generalizability to real-world problems. Accurate detection of hand signals requires distinguishing between intentional and non-intentional signals. The ability to differentiate situations affects the accuracy of detection.
    <li>The paper proposes a new method to recognize hand signals from raw video streams without preprocessing, overcoming the challenges of previous methods that relied on skeleton-based action recognition. The proposed method utilizes an attention-based spatial-temporal graph convolutional network (ASTGCN) that achieved higher accuracy than previous methods and can distinguish between intentional and non-intentional signals. The potential applications of this method include traffic management, public safety, and military operations. The paper highlights the significance of deep learning in recognizing hand signals in real-world environments.
