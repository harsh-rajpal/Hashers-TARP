  <li>Gesture recognition is one of the most difficult challenges in computer vision. While recognising traffic police hand signals, one must take into account the speed and dependability of the instructing signal. It is significantly easier to extract the three-dimensional coordinates of skeletons when depth information is given with the photos. Here, we present a method for detecting hand signals that does not rely on skeletons. Instead of skeletons, we employ basic object detectors that have been trained to respond to hand signals. 
<li>Autonomous vehicles require traffic police gesture recognition. Current traffic police gesture identification systems frequently extract pixel-level characteristics from RGB photos, which are incoherent owing to the absence of gesture skeleton features and can result in erroneous results. Existing object detection algorithms enable the detection of automobiles, trees, people, bicycles, animals, and so forth (YOLO). 

<li>In this project, we will employ the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) approach (Deep Learning) to recognise traffic police hand signals. As there are no acceptable datasets available, we shall attempt to generate our own. 
Mediapipe will be utilised in its development.
